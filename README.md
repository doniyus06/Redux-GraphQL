setup very humble GraphQL Server (based on express & graphiql) and React+Redux Client

to setup:
npm install

to start:
node server

then open localhost:3000
change the query request to not include items, e.g actors or character.
the respons will change, (thats why it is graphql)

open graphiql interface, localhost:3000/graphql
